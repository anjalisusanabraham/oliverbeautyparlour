<h2><i><u>Our Makeup Artists</u></i></h2>
<p>Shimna Thomas is one of the foremost bridal makeup artists in Kerala to bring forth a holistic and avant garde style of makeup. From early on,
     she had realised the importance a bride gives to looking at her best on the most prominent day of her life. This is what makes her works so 
     fascinating and awe inspiring. Her level of dedication seems unparalleled.<br>She is an incessant learner of new styles and keeps updating herself
      with all the latest findings in the field of beauty care and makeup. Starting off with courses and certifications from Loreal (London) and
       Schwarzkopf - Henkel, she moved up the ladder by attending workshops from artists widely regarded across the globe like Laura Mercier, Charlie Green,
        Daniel Bauer and Shahnaz Hussain. She conducts private classes and workshop sessions on bridal makeup throughout the year to share the knowledge she has gathered
         through years of experience in this field.<br>After establishing Angels Beauty Parlour in 1995 and simultaneously performing bridal makeups in numbers,
          she has established a niche for herself. She is very much loved by every one of her customers and this is for no simple reason. If you truly want to witness 
          her much-appreciated talent, check out the Angels Beauty Parlour Facebook page or the instagram collection at www.instagram.com/angels.beautyparlour</p></div></div>
