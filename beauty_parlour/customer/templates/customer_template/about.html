        <p><center>From the moment they opened the doors to the first DBK Salon in 1988 Fari & Frank focused everything they did
             on one goal. It meant more than expertly cutting, styling and colouring hair. They needed to make sure clients were
              comfortable, got the latest precision cuts and styles, and learned how to care for their hair.
            </center>
        </p>
              <p><center>Today, 30 years later, Fari & Frank’s legacy carries on in every family-owned DBK Salon. And for every 
                customer we serve. It’s a formula that ensures you leave after each visit feeling satisfied with the services and
                 products you received – and feeling more beautiful than ever. That’s really what we’re all about.
                </center>
